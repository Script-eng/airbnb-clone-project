# Airbnb Clone Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a full-stack Airbnb Clone project. It is designed to be a comprehensive, real-world application that simulates the core functionalities of a modern booking platform. The primary focus is not just on the final product, but on mastering the entire professional software development lifecycle, from initial design to deployment and maintenance.

## üéØ Project Goals

The main objective of this project is to develop a deep, practical understanding of modern software engineering principles. Key goals include:

-   **Backend & Database Architecture:** Design and develop a robust backend architecture and a scalable relational database schema that can support complex queries and relationships.
-   **Secure API Development:** Build a secure API using GraphQL, with a strong focus on authentication, authorization, and data protection best practices.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation:** Establish a complete CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline for automated testing and seamless deployment, improving development velocity and reliability.
-   **Collaborative Workflows:** Implement industry-standard collaborative workflows using Git and GitHub, including effective branching strategies and pull request management.
-   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Create thorough project documentation, from system design and database schemas to API specifications, ensuring the project is understandable and maintainable.
-   **Technology Integration:** Effectively integrate a modern tech stack to build a cohesive and performant application.
