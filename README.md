## üë• Team Roles

This project simulates a real-world development environment where distinct roles collaborate to build, deploy, and maintain the application.

### Backend Developer

The Backend Developer is responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic of the application. They are the primary architects of the core services that power the platform.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   Implement business logic and application features using the **Django** framework.
*   Design and build the **GraphQL API** for client-server communication.
*   Implement user authentication, authorization, and session management.
*   Write unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

### Database Administrator (DBA)

The Database Administrator designs, implements, and maintains the application's database. They ensure data integrity, performance, and security.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   Design the relational database schema in **MySQL**, defining tables, relationships, and constraints.
*   Manage schema changes and data migrations as the application evolves.
*   Monitor database performance and optimize complex queries for efficiency.
*   Implement backup, recovery, and data security procedures.

### DevOps Engineer

The DevOps Engineer focuses on automating and streamlining the development pipeline. They build the bridge between development and operations to ensure a smooth, efficient, and reliable delivery process.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   Create and manage **Docker** configurations for consistent development and production environments.
*   Set up and maintain the **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** to automate builds, testing, and deployments.
*   Manage application infrastructure, monitoring, and logging.

### Other Key Roles

*   **Security Specialist:** Responsible for application and data security, conducting vulnerability assessments, and implementing security best practices.


## üóÇÔ∏è Database Design

The database is the backbone of the application, designed using a relational model in **MySQL**. The structure is centered around a few key entities that manage users, properties, and the booking process.

### Core Entities

#### 1. Users
Stores information about individuals who sign up, whether they are guests or hosts.

*   `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each user.
*   `email`: User's email address, used for login and communication.
*   `password_hash`: Hashed version of the user's password for secure storage.
*   `full_name`: The user's full name.
*   `created_at`: Timestamp when the user account was created.

#### 2. Properties
Represents the rental listings created by hosts.

*   `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each property.
*   `owner_id` (Foreign Key -> Users.id): The user who owns and manages the property.
*   `title`: The name of the listing (e.g., "Cozy Downtown Loft").
*   `description`: Detailed information about the property.
*   `price_per_night`: The cost to rent the property for one night.
*   `location`: Address or geographical coordinates of the property.

#### 3. Bookings
Represents a confirmed reservation of a property by a user.

*   `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each booking.
*   `user_id` (Foreign Key -> Users.id): The user who made the booking (the guest).
*   `property_id` (Foreign Key -> Properties.id): The property being booked.
*   `start_date`: The check-in date for the reservation.
*   `end_date`: The check-out date for the reservation.
*   `total_price`: The calculated total cost of the stay.

#### 4. Reviews
Contains feedback and ratings left by guests after their stay.

*   `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each review.
*   `booking_id` (Foreign Key -> Bookings.id): The specific booking this review is for.
*   `rating`: A numerical score (e.g., 1-5) given by the guest.
*   `comment`: The textual feedback or comment from the guest.
*   `created_at`: Timestamp when the review was submitted.

#### 5. Payments
Tracks the financial transactions associated with bookings.

*   `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each payment.
*   `booking_id` (Foreign Key -> Bookings.id): The booking this payment is for.
*   `amount`: The total amount paid.
*   `status`: The current state of the payment (e.g., `pending`, `completed`, `failed`).
*   `transaction_id`: The unique ID provided by the payment gateway (e.g., Stripe).

### Entity Relationships

*   **Users & Properties**: A `User` (as a host) can have many `Properties`, but each `Property` belongs to only one `User`. (One-to-Many)
*   **Users & Bookings**: A `User` (as a guest) can make many `Bookings`, but each `Booking` is made by a single `User`. (One-to-Many)
*   **Properties & Bookings**: A `Property` can have many `Bookings`, but a `Booking` is for exactly one `Property`. (One-to-Many)
*   **Bookings & Reviews**: A `Booking` can have at most one `Review`. This ensures a guest can only review a stay once. (One-to-One)
*   **Bookings & Payments**: Each `Booking` is associated with one `Payment` transaction. (One-to-One)
